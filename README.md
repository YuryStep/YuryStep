## Some Code Samples 🧑‍💻
Here you'll find several iOS projects that offer a glimpse into my coding skills, style and problem-solving approach.  

Feel free to explore these samples. The readme file of each project contains **screenshots and videos** of the app, along with a **detailed description**.

Your feedback and inquiries are highly welcomed.

###  [News Catcher](https://github.com/YuryStep/NewsCatcher)
The most interesting sample in terms of code with no third-party libraries. **Layout, Networking, Cache, and Data Storage are written using only standard tools.** 

The three screens are intentionally implemented in different ways  like `CollectionView`, `TableView`, `CollectionView + DiffableDataSource`.

###  [Pandemic Pulse](https://github.com/YuryStep/PandemicPulse)
Visual simulator of virus propagation. The project uses a **custom two-dimensional threadsafe array** for asynchronous model state update. The project was implemented using **MVP + Coordinator** architecture.

###  [Service Navigator](https://github.com/YuryStep/ServiceNavigator)
The list of services with the possibility of opening the appropriate application on tap (in case it installed) or redirecting to the web-version of the service. The project was implemented using **CleanSwift + Coordinator** architecture.

### [iWeather](https://github.com/YuryStep/iWeather)

This sample has a slightly more complex layout created with `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` together with `DiffableDataSource`. 
The layout from `Figma` is replicated with the use of custom  icons, fonts, and **custom TabBarController**.  


### [ArtiWall](https://github.com/YuryStep/ArtiWall)

This sample intentionally uses several third-party libraries (via cocoapods) as well as **custom transition animation** between the controllers. 


## Useful snippets and drafts 📝
It's much more convenient to share links to interesting drafts by placing them directly on the main page. So I'm going to post some stuff here in the nearest future...
