## Some Code Samples 🧑‍💻
Here you'll find several iOS projects that offer a glimpse into my coding skills, style and problem-solving approach.  
Feel free to explore these samples.
Your feedback and inquiries are highly welcomed.

###  [News Catcher](https://github.com/YuryStep/NewsCatcher)
The most interesting sample in terms of code with no third-party libraries. **Layout, Networking, Cache, and Data Storage are written using only standard tools.** 

The three screens are intentionally combined in different ways (`CollectionView`, `TableView`, CollectionView with `DiffableDataSource`).*

The [readme](https://github.com/YuryStep/NewsCatcher) contains screenshots and videos of the app, in addition to a detailed description.

### [iWeather](https://github.com/YuryStep/iWeather)

This sample has a slightly more complex layout created with `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` together with `DiffableDataSource`. 
The layout from `Figma` is replicated with the use of custom  icons, fonts, and TabBarController.  

The [readme](https://github.com/YuryStep/iWeather) contains screenshots and videos of the app, in addition to a detailed description.

### [ArtiWall](https://github.com/YuryStep/ArtiWall)

This sample intentionally uses several third-party libraries (via cocoapods) as well as custom transition animation between the controllers. 

The [readme](https://github.com/YuryStep/ArtiWall) contains screenshots and videos of the app, in addition to a detailed description.

## Useful snippets and drafts 📝
It's much more convenient to share links to interesting drafts by placing them directly on the main page. So I'm going to post some stuff here in the nearest future...
